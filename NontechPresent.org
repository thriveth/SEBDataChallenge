* The main question
#+begin_quote
 Can we find behavioral or demographic clues to how likely people are
 to hold a loan?
#+end_quote

* The Data set
- Table of customer information
- Table of financial transactions
- Table of demographic information for customers' home region

* Customer behavior

** Average # of transactions per customer

** Average amount spent by customer

| By gender                   | By district                       |

Gender has very little impact on total spending. Geography a bit more,
but not strong. 

* Visual clues: What predicts the value of ~LOAN~?

** /Violin plots/ are good at comparing distributions

If there is a clear difference in the distribution of people who do
and do not have loans, then the quantity is a good predictor of =LOAN=


** Salary, urban ratio, and birth date are poor predictors

The birthdate is best, but I do not quite understand why.

* Model: Decision tree

** Example: Depth 3

** Indeed, ~ACCOUNT_ID~ seems to the strongest predictor
(This is probably not a real effect!)

** Most important factors are a bit suprpising

1. ~ACCOUNT_ID~
2. ~BIRTH_DT~

/More work is needed!/
Thank your for your attention.
